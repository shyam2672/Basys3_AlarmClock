Designing an Alarm Clock using basys 3 FPGA chip

Made use of Basys 3 FPGA Board which was programmed using Verilog language.
Also Xilinx software was used to code and run the same on FPGA board.
Alarm Clock has a faster clock speed along with am/pm mode and a 12 hour format for time.
Time is set in binary mode and the alarm goes off when set time is reached which is indicated by beeping of led display and ringing of buzzer.
